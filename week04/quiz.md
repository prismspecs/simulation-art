# Unity Quiz 1

This quiz is intended to gauge comprehension of the skills and concepts we've covered thus far. Successfully completion will include synthesizing concepts and a creative approach.

This is open note, open internet, open everything. The only limitation is that you can't chat with your classmates about how to solve these problems.

## Choose 3 of the following

+ Create a scene in which a sphere moves around a 3-dimensional space randomly and does not leave an area that is roughly ten units large (you can think of this as cubic or spherical space)

+ Create a scene in which Game Objects are spawned above a plane continuously. When these objects hit the plane, they shrink (either continuously or once). Also, when these objects hit the plane they print a message in the Debug Console.

+ Create a rough approximation of our solar system. Planets must have independent orbits but these can be circular. They must rotate around a sun but also have independent relative rotation.

+ Create a scene with Game Objects that walk around randomly. The scene should begin with at least 10 of these objects. When they collide, they merge into a single object and grow in the process. Print a Debug message noting the time that each merge happens.

+ Create a sketch that starts with a random number of a prefab object. Each prefab instance has a 10% chance of spawning a new lot of prefab instances after 3 seconds. After the 3 second timer has passed, whether the prefab spawned more objects or not, it dies.

+ Create a scene in which Game Objects move towards a glowing area. Once they get to the glowing area, they are taken upwards as if captured by a UFO. This should be a continuous process, with many Game Objects being captured. Once the Game Objects reach an arbitrary height (or reach a UFO object) they should be destroyed.

+ Create a "moth" Game Object that is attracted to light. Create several of them and have them react to multiple light sources being turned on and off continuously.
