		+ On play
			> But this association of video games with leisure is not a necessary condition. It is, rather, a by-product of a misunderstanding of the nature of play. Instead of understanding play as child’s activity, or as the means to consume games, or even as the shifting centers of meaning in poststructuralist thought, I suggest adopting Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman’s useful, abstract definition of the term: “play is the free space of movement within a more rigid structure.”7 Understood in this sense, play refers to the “possibility space” created by constraints of all kinds. Play activities are not rooted in one social practice, but in many social and material practices. For example, Salen and Zimmerman use the example of the play in a mechanism like a steering column, in which the meshing gears create “play” in the wheel before the turning gesture causes the gears to couple.
