+ Office Hours: Tuesday (5-6pm), Wednesday (12:30-2:30pm)

## Description

Game design enables a new rhetorical form in which systems can be expressed. In this class we will look at artists and game designers who work within the paradigm of digital simulation and game strategy. We will utilize software such as Unity3d, board games, and other media to simulate, or "gamify," the inner workings of the social, economic, and political systems around us. This class is a studio/seminar hybrid, so students should be prepared to read, discuss, create, and critique.

## Learning Goals

+ Produce original analysis to describe various social, economic, and natural systems
+ Understand navigation of 3d environments
+ Understand basic scripting for interaction and 3d environments
+ Understand the basics of the Unity development environment
+ Understand Agent Based Models of simulation
+ Understand Procedural Rhetoric, the new rhetorical form enabled by software and video games

## Attendance & Participation

Students are allowed two unexcused absences, after which each absence or tardiness will negatively impact one's attendance grade by 9%. Being late is equivalent to half an absence. Missing five classes will result in a failing final grade.

Students are expected to participate in class discussion and group critiques regularly. Full participation will require keeping up with the texts. Being unprepared for a discussion, or failing to participate generally, will have a grade penalty equal to tardiness.

## Academic Integrity and Honor Code

The Honor Code: Oberlin College students are on their honor to uphold a high degree of academic integrity. All work that students submit is expected to be of their own creation and give proper credit to the ideas and work of others. When students write and sign the Honor Pledge, they are affirming that they have not cheated, plagiarized, fabricated, or falsified information, nor assisted others in these actions.

Honor Pledge: "I have adhered to the Honor Code in this assignment."

## Accommodations / College Disability Services

Students with disabilities of any kind who may need disability-related classroom accommodations for this course are encouraged to contact the staff of Disability Resources at the Center for Student Success. They can be reached at drcss@oberlin.edu or 440-775-5588

I am interested in supporting your success in this course, students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must present me with a letter/documentation from Disability Resources. Please contact me as early as possible so that we can work together.

## Counseling and Mental Health

College is an incredible time of discovery, opportunity, and excitement. College can also be an extremely stressful and difficult experience. If you find yourself struggling, there are resources on campus that can help support you in the ways that you need. The Counseling Center is one of those resources. They are available by phone (M-F, 8:30-4:30) at 440-775-8470 and after hours at 440-775-8470, press "2". More info at https://www.oberlin.edu/counseling

## Media Lab & Etiquette

You will need to use the Media Lab outside of class in order to complete your projects. Please refer to the lab monitor hours on the door.

Keep the Media Lab neat and tidy. Remember that this is a shared workspace, and to be courteous of other students and their projects.

## Projects

1. Simulate a System
	+ Think about a system. This can be a social, economic, natural, or any other type of system you can think of. Using Nicky Case's simulation builder [Simulating the World with Emojis](http://ncase.me/simulating/), build a representation of that system. You will need to experiment to get the best results. Case's system might require you to pare down the forces at work, or re-think of the system as something inherently cartographic. Remember you can change the size of the simulation (in some cases, larger might be better).
2. World Building
	+ As a practical Unity exercise, create an autonomous environment that represents data. This project will respond to the needs of the class, so more info TBA.
3. Final Project
	+ Produce something in a medium of your choice that engages with the topics we've explored in class. This will likely be a simulation, though you may choose to embody this in physical performance, a board game, a Unity-based simulation, an experimental lecture, etc.
