## Announcements

## Tuesday

+ Continue exhibiting Project 2
+ Discuss Final Projects
	+ Questions to get you thinking
		+ What work have we looked at this semester that you find particularly interesting or inspiring? Why do you find it to be interesting or inspiring?
		+ Given the state of the world, what sort of art/culture would you opt to produce and why? What good are simulations? In creating art, is the goal to create an entertaining distraction? To advocate? To transgress?
		+ How does something like Live Simulation fit into the art historical narrative? Or a history of cinema? Of computer science?

+ Discuss (time permitting)
	+ [Ian Cheng's Emissaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TO6Luilc4Bo)
		+ How does something like Live Simulation fit into a trajectory of art history?
		+ In what ways does this differ from painting? In what ways does it differ from Video Art?
		+ Is it important that it happens live, as opposed to rendering and saving a file of an instance of the simulation?
