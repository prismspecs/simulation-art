## Homework
+ Finish visual environments inside of Unity (due this Thurs)
+ Create a dynamic movement simulation using the LookAt, move forward, repel, etc. scripts we played with in class. Add some behavior to objects, such as
	+ When they collide, something happens
	+ Every so often, they switch from repel to attract
	+ There are random obstacles
	+ There are random or sequential environmental changes
	+ There are objects that have entirely different behavioral styles
+ Play
