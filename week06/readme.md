		> This separation between experience and the system within which we operate results in increased alienation — we feel adrift in a world we don’t understand. In this regard, Jameson notes that the proliferation of conspiracy theories is partly a cultural response to this situation. Conspiracy theories act by narrowing down the agency behind our world to a single figure of power (whether it be the Bilderberg Group, Freemasons, or some other convenient scapegoat). Despite the extraordinary complexity of some conspiracy theories, they nevertheless provide a reassuringly simple answer to ‘who is behind it all’. They, in other words, act precisely as a cognitive map.

		> In that regard, the key means to understanding the economy is through technical tools such as computer algorithms, simulation models, econometrics and other statistical analyses. It is these sorts of cognitive prostheses that allow for the perception of otherwise invisible systems like capitalism. We have to take seriously here media theorist Friedrich Kittler’s point (from his book, Optical Media) that ‘perceptible and aesthetic properties are always only dependent variables of technical feasibility’. The continued expansion of technology is both a call and a means to expand our cognitive mapping of economic systems.

		> Aesthetics, under this conception, is what sensibly mediates between individual phenomenology and our cognitive maps of global structures. Yet here I think we can parse Jameson’s conception of aesthetics into two parts by drawing a distinction between the aesthetics of the technical sublime and the aesthetics of interfaces. That is to say, between data as impenetrable noise and data as cognitively tractable. The act of building mediators between these is precisely one of the most important areas where political art could be situated today.

		> Cognitive mapping, therefore, risks generating only an aesthetics of the technical sublime — one which awes us with overwhelming amounts of data, but provides little cognitive purchase on the underlying mechanisms. It is this which binds many contemporary artistic attempts to render global finance visible. We are left with, at best, being physiologically manipulated into Stendhal syndrome. Cognitive mapping left at the level of the technical sublime provides us with no cognitive and sensible leverage over our future. In particular, it remains incapable of overcoming the contemporary dystopian vision of the future. According to Marxist theorist Franco Berardi, ‘The future becomes a threat when the collective imagination becomes incapable of seeing alternatives to trends leading to devastation, increased poverty, and violence’. The entrenched nature of global capitalism — the zombie neoliberalism stumbling on even after its death blow — rends the future into an implacably dystopian time. Climate change, resource wars, social conflict, rising inequality and greater militarisation are all the phenomenological givens of the future.

		> Yet if an aesthetics of big data is incapable of rendering this complexity tractable, then what is necessary is a transformation of the aesthetic sublime into an aesthetics of the interface. The latter indexes the mediation between big and complex data on the one hand, and our finite cognitive capacities on the other. In this space, art can become a weaponised political tool.

## Unity Tutorial(s) for this week

+ [Roll a Ball Game Tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/roll-ball-tutorial)
	+ Some of this will be easy for you now (which is great), but it will also serve to unify a lot of the tools we've used. So if you want the structured practice, this is a good tutorial.

## Homework

+ Play, over the course of the next two weeks:
	+ [Post/Capitalism](https://colestia.itch.io/postcapitalism)
	+ [Crisis Theory](https://colestia.itch.io/crisis-theory)
	+ [Papers, Please]()
	+ [The Founder](https://thefounder.biz/play/)
