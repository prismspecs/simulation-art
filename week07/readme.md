## Homework

+ Project 2: World Building

	> Worldbuilding is the process of constructing an imaginary world, sometimes associated with a whole fictional universe. The resulting world may be called a constructed world. Developing an imaginary setting with coherent qualities such as a history, geography, and ecology is a key task for many science fiction or fantasy writers. Worldbuilding often involves the creation of maps, a backstory, and people for the world. Constructed worlds can enrich the backstory and history of fictional works, and it is not uncommon for authors to revise their constructed worlds while completing its associated work. Constructed worlds can be created for personal amusement and mental exercise, or for specific creative endeavors such as novels, video games, or role-playing games.

	+ Drawing on the skills developed thus far in the class, build a world that stems from a concept or backstory. Think: What can you convey about this place without a verbal disclaimer to the class? How can you work to queue your viewer/participant in to a fictional universe through aesthetics? What role can sound play in this? Perhaps its worth risking an earnest approach rather than relying on humor.
	+ This will be the most ambitious project yet. Whereas we have completed various exercises in Unity, this is a graded project and must demonstrate a considerable investment of time and effort. The parameters for this project are as follows:
		+ The experience must span at least three minutes
		+ Your project can be completed in any media. If you choose Unity, VR is an option but you must coordinate a schedule with one another (use Slack)
		+ You should operate from a concept and use your world to aestheticize it
		+ Think of this as an art installation. Perhaps your work can speak for itself.
		+ This will be due on (11/6)
		+ There will be a progress report on 10/30 when we return from break. 30% of your Project 2 grade will be based on this progress report.
	+ As Ian Cheng's work will feature heavily in our class moving forward, you may find the following inspiring or helpful in the service of this assignment
		+ [The Cyborg Anthropologist: Ian Cheng on His Sentient Artworks](http://www.artnews.com/2016/03/31/the-cyborg-anthropologist-ian-cheng-discusses-his-sentient-art-works/)
		+ [Video Interview: A Portal to Infinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TO6Luilc4Bo)
	+ And likewise, in thinking about world building as something that can take place across various media, there is a breadth of history to be gleaned from D&D:
		+ [Matthew Mercer Explains How To Be A Good Dungeon Master](https://kotaku.com/matthew-mercer-explains-how-to-be-a-good-dungeon-master-1826508992)
		> Instead of a place for story to happen, or characters for a story to happen to, he sees the entire apparatus of D&D to be an opportunity for story and plot to emerge.
