+ Project 1 (draft) due Tuesday
	+ Simulate a System
		+ Think about a system. This can be a social, economic, natural, or any other type of system you can think of. Using Nicky Case's simulation builder [Simulating the World with Emojis](http://ncase.me/simulating/model/), build a representation of that system. You will need to experiment to get the best results. Case's system might require you to pare down the forces at work, or re-think of the system as something inherently cartographic. Remember you can change the size of the simulation (in some cases, larger might be better).
